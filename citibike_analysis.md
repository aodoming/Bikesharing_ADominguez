# New York City (NYC) Bike Analysis
With almost 900 bike-share systems and generally bike-share boom in the country and around the world, the city of Des Moines’ is ripped for its bike-share locations. According to the countryeconomy.com (https://countryeconomy.com/countries/usa-states/compare/iowa/new-york) the population of Des Moines in 2018 was about 3.2 million, while NYC was about 20 million. While the difference in population is huge, the population make up of male, female and median age, is similar (https://censusreporter.org/profiles/16000US1921000-des-moines-ia/). 
Recognized as the fastest-growing city in the Midwest, bike-share in Des Moines as in populated cities such as New York City (NYC) could yield dividends. For both locals and tourists, it’s a way to get around the city faster and smarter, while keeping healthy. 


## Proportion of Customer Type:
It is no surprise therefore that bike-share is well received. The NYC bike-share proportion of Annual Subscribers to everyday customers are high in comparison. Des Moines is likely to experience the same.


## Peak Rental Hours:
In NYC, peak rental hours for bike trips is around 5:00pm – 7:00pm. This is the most active time during the day in August. As in NYC, August has mostly nice weathers in Des Moines and so it is safe to say that we’ll need the most bikes then and in similar months, for the aforementioned peak hours of the day. This also means that to free up most bikes for the peak hours, bike maintenance has to be scheduled outside of the peak usage hours.


## Highest traffic Locations:
According to a nyc.gov pdf file, https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/plans/transportation/bike_share_complete.pdf bicycling is used as commuter mode by significantly more people. The article states, “The 2000 US Census indicates that approximately 15,000 New York City residents commute to work by bicycle; this is one third again as many bicycle commuters as Los Angeles and almost twice as many as San Francisco, the cities with the next largest bicycle commuter populations. In addition to that, we could deduce from the NYC data and specifically the symbol map that tourists’ areas see a lot of activity as well. 
The NYC’ s highest traffic (start to end) locations found in the areas noted by the darker colors on the symbol map could help us understand the when and where people would use bikes in Des Moines. Like NYC, Des Moines could experience high traffic in the city where residents mean travel time to work is about 19 minutes (https://censusreporter.org/profiles/16000US1921000-des-moines-ia/).


## Gender Breakdown of Active Riders:
In NYC, the males are known to be the active riders in the city, then the female population. The small number who identifies as unknown are the inactive riders. This is good news for Des Moines whose population is about 49% male to 51% female. 


## Average Duration of Bike-ride by Age:
Also seen in the NYC data is the average duration of bike-ride by age, the younger the age the longer the bike-rides. The general trend is that younger riders tend to use the bikes for longer periods of time. 
So, for Des Moines whose median age is 33.9 and 43% of their population are between the ages 20-49, not only will the bike-share program thrive, but also it will be profitable, busy and experience long rides on the bikes.
